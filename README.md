# Assignment 2 ECore Model
# Chess Evolved Board Setup Model

Setting up a chess board can be quite tiresome manually, specially in terms of implementing data where needed and overall structure.
Thus this Board Setup Metamodel defines the rules of how you can setup a chess board with customization features such as board size and custom chess pieces.

When it comes where this model is supposed to be placed please read the Domain section of this README.

## Repository Structure

When it comes to naming scheme, It was too late to realize that the model itself would be named as "ass2".
But I did find it quite humourous in the end. But originally the name for the model should've been chessGame.

### Domain Description: Chess Evolved

This metamodel defines the structure for Chess Evolved, which is a customizable chess variant system that extends traditional chess with configurable board rules, pieces, piece abilities, and custom movement patterns for the pieces.

### What is Chess Evolved?

Chess Evolved transforms classic chess by allowing players to customize board sizes (8x8 to 16x16), game modes (Classic, Fog of War), piece types, and special abilites. The system supports creating and saving game configurations that can be loaded into the Chess Evolved game system for actual gameplay.

### What Does This Metamodel Capture?

The metamodel represents a complete game configuration/instance, including:
- A lobby with two players (Player One and Player Two).
    - The lobby also supports saving a lobbyID, but in reality this would be generated by the actual system.
- Board setup: size, game mode, and initial piece placements.
- Custom piece definitions with their positions, colors, and movement capabilites.
- Game state information ready to be played.

### Piece Definition

Each piece is characterized by:
- Position: x, and y coordinates on the board. No two pieces can be placed on the same coordinate.
- Name of the piece. Such as "Rook" or "Samurai" (Custom).
- Color: White or Black.
- Move Patterns: Reusable MoveDefinitions objects that define how the piece moves realtive to its current position using moveX and moveY offsets.

### Move Constraints

Each move definition includes behavioral flags that determine when the move is valid during gameplay.
- isInifinite: Flag for repeating the move until obstruction (rook, bishop).
- canJump: Can move over pieces (knight)
- firstMoveOnly: Only available on the first move (pawn)
- canCapture, canMoveOnly, canCaptureOnly: Capture/Movement constriants.

### Abilities

Pieces can have optional abilities (Active/Passive) with cooldown mechanics that enhance gameplay with special powers.

### Current Status

Although this model captures the essence of Chess Evolved, it is not yet integrated to the project as for now. This metamodel only provides the structural foundation for defining game variants that will result into different playable products for the system.
